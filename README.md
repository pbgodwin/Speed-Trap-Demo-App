Speed Trap Demo App
=====================================

This is a simple Windows Store app that uses Windows Azure Mobile Services and Bing Maps to build a crowd sourced map of speed traps. 

To run this code, you need the following:

[Bing Maps for Windows 8 SDK (Beta)](http://bit.ly/PGBingMapAPI)

[Bing Maps API Key](http://bingmapsportal.com)

[Azure Mobile Services SDK](http://bit.ly/PGAMS)

[A Windows Azure account (90 Day Trial here)](http://bit.ly/PGAzureTrial)

This code is very messy, but it should give you an idea of how you can use Azure and Bing Maps to build powerful apps.

Possible TODO:
===========================
- Push Notifications for Speed Traps near the user
- Share Contract implementation
- Live Tiles
